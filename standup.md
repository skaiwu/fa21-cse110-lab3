# Standup Notes
## Best time for everyone
### Recommendation - 10am
It is important to pick a time that works for everyone on a team and that it stays consistent </br>
The best time for everyone is 10am, so standup will be at 10am.</br>

Anything major done for any stories or tasks assigned.</br>
I have gone through story 3 and added in the proper css for the website.</br>
## What Will I do today
Anything major that will be done for stories or tasks assigned</br>
Today, I will add in ReactJS to the page to add some more UI.</br>
## Issues Blocking me
Any major blockers that are preventing progress.</br>

## Progress Update
